Professional photographers working for cultural heritage institutions
take effort to produce color calibrated images. This is achieved by
photographing a standard color target and accordingly adjust color
values of subsequent images taken with the same camera + lights setup.
Due to the complexity of color management it is quite possible to make a
mistake. For this reason, it is important to have the possibility to
check if the color values of the color managed TIF image of the color
target are in agreement with the tabulated values for the color target.
Until recently an online service provided by Pictura was available to
photographers to upload their TIF images for such a check. Unfortunately
this service is no longer available.

This tiny python package `colorchecker2cielab` is developed to provide a
quick method to automatically extract CIELAB color values from a TIF
image of a XYZ Colorchecker target.
