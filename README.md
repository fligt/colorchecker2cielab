# Welcome to colorchecker2cielab

Professional photographers working for cultural heritage institutions
take effort to produce color calibrated images. This is achieved by
photographing a standard color target and accordingly adjust color
values of subsequent images taken with the same camera + lights setup.
This process is called color management. Due to the complexity of color
management it is quite possible to make a mistake. For this reason, it
is important to have the possibility to check if the color values of the
color managed TIF image of the color target are in agreement with the
tabulated values for the color target. Until recently an online service
provided by [Picturae](https://picturae.com/en/) was available to
photographers to upload their TIF images for such a check. Unfortunately
this service is no longer available.

This tiny python package `colorchecker2cielab` with a long name is
developed to provide a quick way to automatically extract CIELAB color
values from a TIF image of a [Digital Colorchecker
SG](https://www.xrite.com/categories/calibration-profiling/colorchecker-digital-sg)
target.

This package is under development. Documentation can already be found
[here](https://fligt.github.io/colorchecker2cielab/).
